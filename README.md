# React + Vite

The Blog App is a platform built with React.js and JavaScript, enabling users to create and publish blogs with images. It features a Real-Time Editor (RTE) that offers rich text formatting, including options like bold, italic, and more, for a dynamic writing experience. Users can also explore blogs from others, making the app a hub for content creators and readers alike. Developed using modern front-end technologies, this app provides an efficient and interactive blogging experience
